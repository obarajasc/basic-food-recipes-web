    <img src="../images/tamales.jpg" alt="Corn Tamales">
    <p>Tamales are delicious savory or sweet parcels made with masa dough (corn-based dough) and fillings, wrapped in
        corn husks and steamed. Here's a quick overview:</p>

    <h2>Basic Components:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Traditionally pork shoulder, but chicken or seafood can be used.</li>
        <li>Hominy: Large-kernel corn treated with lime, adding a unique texture and flavor.</li>
        <li>Broth: Pork, chicken, or vegetable broth forms the base.</li>
        <li>Masa dough: Made from masa harina (corn flour), lard or shortening, broth, and seasoning.</li>
        <li>Filling: Savory options like shredded meat, vegetables, and sauce; sweet options like fruit, nuts, and
            spices.</li>
        <li>Corn husks: Soaked and softened for wrapping.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Assembly:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Spread masa dough onto a softened corn husk.</li>
        <li>Add a dollop of filling in the center.</li>
        <li>Fold the husk to enclose the filling, creating a neat packet.</li>
        <li>Optionally, tie the husk with string for secure closure.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Cooking:</h2>
    <p>Tamales are traditionally steamed in a steamer basket over boiling water for 1-2 hours, until the masa
        dough is cooked through and the filling is heated.</p>

    <h2>Variations:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Regional Styles: Different regions in Mexico have unique tamale styles with distinct fillings and
            preparation methods.</li>
        <li>Savory Fillings: Popular options include pork, chicken, beans, cheese, and chiles.</li>
        <li>Sweet Fillings: Fruits like pineapple, guava, and banana are common choices.</li>
        <li>Instant Pot or Oven Cooking: Modern variations use pressure cookers or ovens for faster cooking.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tips:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Use warm masa dough for easier spreading.</li>
        <li>Don't overfill the tamales to prevent bursting.</li>
        <li>Experiment with different fillings and spices to personalize your tamales.</li>
    </ul>
